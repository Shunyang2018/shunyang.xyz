title: Predicting Electron Ionization Mass Spectra Using Excited-State Molecular Dynamics
summary: We provide an algorithm that introduces excited states into the molecular dynamics prediction of the 70 eV electron ionization mass spectra. We recommend adding excited-state calculations for predicting the electron ionization mass spectra of small molecules in metabolomics.
