title: Quantum Chemical Prediction of Electron Ionization Mass Spectra of Trimethylsilylated Metabolites
summary: We chose 816 trimethylsilyl derivatives of organic acids, alcohols, amides, amines, and thiols to compare in silico-generated spectra against the experimental EI mass spectra from the NIST17 library, suggesting that QCEIMS methods can be extended to compounds that are not present in experimental databases.
