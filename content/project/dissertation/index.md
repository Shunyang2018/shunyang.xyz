title: "Dissertation: Theoretical and experimental explorations on compound identification in metabolomics"
summary: This dissertation describes computational studies, using molecular dynamics, on in-silico mass spectra of small molecules generation. Chapter 1 provides an overview of applications of quantum chemistry to generate in-silico mass spectra. Chapter 2 showcases the performance of quantum chemistry simulations on small molecules and probes the parameter space to find potential improvements to the existing method. The conformational flexibility effect is also explored and has no correlation with prediction accuracy. Chapter 3 describes a new workflow to include chemical derivation, especially silylation in the quantum chemistry calculation. Different compound classes including organic acid, alcohol, amide, amine and thiols are simulated and compared against experimental mass spectra. The molecular dynamics trajectories are also investigated to find missed fragmentations from rearrangements. Chapter 4 provides a new algorithm that introduces excited state calculation into the molecular dynamics prediction of mass spectra. The new algorithm can predict more fragmentation reactions that are missing in previous studies and as a result, the mass spectral similarity scores are increased, and simulation is more accurate. Chapter 4 also discusses the limitations of molecular dynamics simulation time and lack of rearrangement reactions. Chapter 5 provides another routine from experimental side to help unknown metabolites identification with methane chemical ionization and quadrupole-time of flight mass spectrometry.
