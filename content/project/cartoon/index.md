title: "Dissertation: Theoretical and experimental explorations on compound identification in metabolomics"
summary: Chapter 1-4 describes computational studies, using molecular dynamics, on in-silico mass spectra of small molecules generation. Chapter 5 provides another routine from experimental side to help unknown metabolites identification with methane chemical ionization and quadrupole-time of flight mass spectrometry.
